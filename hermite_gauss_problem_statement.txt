Consider the first excited state wavefunction of harmonic oscillator 

Ψ1(x)=Axe−x22


where A is a normalization constant. Write a python program to find the value of A using the following relation: 

∫∞−∞|Ψ1(x)|2dx=1
 

Note: 1) Use the Hermite-Gauss quadrature. 
          2) You need not to take any input for this problem. Evaluate your program directly after you finished writing. 
          3) Usage of the build-in function for integration is strictly prohibited. 

          4) For the five-point rule, the weight factors and nodes/roots are given below, 

  
  
 
         
       
       
       
Weight factor (w) 	Nodes/Roots     (x)

0.393619	0.958572
0.393619	-0.958572
