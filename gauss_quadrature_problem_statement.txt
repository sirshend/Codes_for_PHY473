Write a Python program to calculate the approximate value of the integral ∫∞0x2e−cxdx using five-point Laguerre-Gauss quadrature rule. Take c as input. 

Round the answer up to 2 decimal places. 

Note: 1) You should take c as an input to your program.  

2) For the five point rule, the weight factors and nodes/roots are given below,

  
  
 
         
       
       
       
Weight factor (w) 	Nodes/Roots     (x) 
0.521756	0.26356
0.398667	1.4134
0.0759424	3.59643
0.00361176	7.08581
0.00002337	12.6408




2)  Usage of the build-in function for integration is strictly prohibited.  

Example:
INPUT:
1.0

OUTPUT:
2.0
