Write a python program to estimate the following integral using Simpson’s 3/8-rule.

∫baexln(x)dx
 

Divide the integration interval into N segments of equal width, where N is multiple of  3. The values of a, b, and N will be specified as input.  

The input will consist of three lines, with the first and second lines specifying a and b respectively. The third line will contain the value for N.

Round off your answer up to 2 decimal places.

Note: 1) Usage of the build-in function for integration is strictly prohibited. 


Example:
INPUT:
2.0
3.0
99

OUTPUT:
13.68
