Interpolate a smooth function y=ex+1 on the interval 0≤x≤1.0 using five points Lagrange interpolation. Plot error vs x for this case, where x will be in the range of 0≤x≤1.0 with 20 equally spaced data points.

Note: 
1) error = Value from function - Interpolated value 

2) Upon running the initial template code, Prutor will generate a URL in the output console. You have to copy and paste this URL in the address bar of your browser to view the plots generated by your code. Remember to open a new tab in your browser before pasting the URL. Note that the URL is generated by the last line of the code i.e, pl.plot(plt, 'file_name.pdf'). This line is necessary to evaluate your submissions correctly. You have to import the extra library necessary for generating the plot. Also, your plot should be labeled properly. NO NEED TO VERIFY TEST CASES FOR THIS PROBLEM. If you find your plot is correct, then submit your code.
