The velocity of a particle is

v(t)=sin(t)(t+1)2


where initial position of the particle is x(t=0)=0. Write a python program to estimate the  position of the particle at t=2 using Simpson's 1/3 rule. 
Divide the integration interval into N number of segments of equal width. The value of N will be specified as input. 
Round the answer up to 2 decimal places.

Note: 1) x(t)=âˆ«20v(t)dt. 
         2) You should take N as an input to your program.
         3) Usage of the build-in function for integration is strictly prohibited.  
 
Example:
INPUT:
10

OUTPUT:
0.34
